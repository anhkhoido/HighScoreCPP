This repository contains a program written in C++ that keeps track of the highest number ever inputted by the user.

At the beginning, the user is asked to input a number, which will be stored into a text file. Afterwards, if the program has been used at least twice, the highest number ever inputted will be displayed.

In short, this is the model of a program that keeps track of a player's high score in a video game.
